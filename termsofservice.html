                            What is Thank U Cash 
                    </h4>
                    <p class="p">
                            Welcome! Thank U Cash is a rewards program operated by Connected Analytics Limited (referred to as “Thank U Cash” or “we” or “us”). Thank U Cash lets you earn Thank U Cash rewards points (“Points”) by making qualifying purchases at certain retail and service companies and through other promotions and offers that may be provided by merchants (“merchants,” whom we may also refer to as “partners”) or other merchants. Fully enrolled Thank U Cash members (“Members”) may use the Points they earn for savings at participating locations of specified merchants. Visit https://www.thankucash.com/merchant for a complete list of merchants, as well as complete information on where you can earn and use Points. merchants are subject to change at any time. 
                    </p>

                            There is no cost to join Thank U Cash. However, you must fully enroll in order to use Points. You are not a Member until you have fully enrolled. Merely having a Thank U Cash rewards card does mean you are a member, however you would need the Thank U Cash App to track your rewards. 
                    </p> 
                    <p class="p">
                            In most cases, you may use any form of payment (e.g., cash, credit, debit) accepted by a given merchant to make qualifying purchases that earn Points. You do not need a credit card to join Thank U Cash. Neither the Thank U Cash program nor the rewards card that Thank U Cash provides to you is a credit card. Enrolling in Thank U Cash will not result in an inquiry to the credit bureaus. Points that have been credited to your account for at least two years will never expire but you are advised to use it as soon as possible. For more information, see “How Can I Use Points?” below.

        Can I Earn or Use Thank U Cash Points If I Am Not A Member?
</h4>
<p class="p">
        Before you fully enroll and become a Member, you are still subject to these Terms. Until you fully enroll and become a Member, you are not eligible to use Points for savings or take advantage of many great Thank U Cash offers. However, you can still earn Points when you make qualifying purchases at our merchants, and we will track those Points accordingly. Once you do fully enroll and become a Member, we will then provide you with the ability to use at certain merchants those Points that you earned before you fully enrolled.

    <h4 class="h4">
            How do I Earn Points?

    </h4>
    <p class="p">
            Members may earn Points in various ways, which may include by:<br/>

Making Qualifying Purchases<br/><br/>
Redeeming Offers and Promotions<br/><br/>
Using Associated Payment Cards<br/><br/>
Qualifying purchases:
 Each merchant will have different ways for you to earn Points. You will not receive Points for: items excluded by law; shipping amounts; the value of any merchant discounts or coupons; items and services that a particular merchant or Thank U Cash deems ineligible; or, in most cases, taxes. Please go to www.thankucash.com for more information about how and where you can earn Points at merchants, including which items or services do not constitute qualifying purchases at that merchant.<br/> <br/>
Purchases can generally be made with any form of payment accepted by that merchant, except that, in some instances, you will only earn Points if you use a linked credit or debit card. (For more information on linking, see the following paragraph.) In addition, at some merchants or merchants, you may need to link your Thank U Cash account with the account that you have with that merchant in order to earn Points on qualifying purchases. <br/><br/>
To earn Points on qualifying purchases, you need to present and use a Thank U Cash Identifier prior to purchasing qualifying items or services from participating merchant locations. Your primary Thank U Cash Identifier is the Thank U Cash rewards card we issue you. Other Thank U Cash Identifiers, which you may be able to use at select merchant locations, can include the key tag we provide to you, your 16 digit Thank U Cash account number, a phone number associated with your Thank U Cash account, the digital Thank U Cash rewards card contained within the Thank U Cash app, or, in some cases, your linked credit or debit card. Please visit our website for more information about which Thank U Cash Identifiers can be used at each merchant and if there are any additional identifiers that can be used for a particular merchant.
<br/><br/>
                Offers & Promotions:

                Some of our merchants may provide you with additional ways to receive Points through offers, promotions, and other programs. Such offers and promotions may be subject to additional terms and conditions. Many offers or promotions will require activation by you on the Thank U Cash app. Certain offers or promotions may require you to link a credit or debit card to your Thank U Cash account and use that card to pay when you make a qualifying purchase. Where applicable, details will be provided on www.thankucard.co regarding how to link your credit or debit card.
                <br/><br/>
                Associated Payment Cards:
 Certain payment cards associated with Thank U Cash may be available to you (“Associated Payment Cards”). You are not required to have an Associated Payment Card to be a Member, but having an Associated Payment Card may provide you with additional ways to earn Points. Your Thank U Cash rewards card issued to you by Thank U Cash is not an Associated Payment Card. You will need to separately apply for any Associated Payment Card, which will require you to undergo credit approval and will be subject to separate terms. Among other things, these separate terms may describe how and where you can earn Points, whether you need to link your Thank U Cash rewards card with your Associated Payment Card, and/or whether you need to present both your Thank U Cash Identifier and the Associated Payment Card in order to earn Points.

            </p>

                    Availability of Points
        
            </h4>
            <p class="p">
                    We will not credit Points to your account until we receive information about a qualifying purchase. In most instances, we will receive purchase information and credit Points in real time or within 48 hours. However, in some instances, it may take up to 90 days for us to receive purchase information and credit Points. Please note that, for online or shipped purchases, most merchants do not process your transaction until the item(s) ships or is delivered (not when you place the order). Similarly, travel purchases are usually not processed until after travel occurs. Thank U Cash is not responsible for the failure or delay of a merchant, any other merchant, or the issuer of an Associated Payment Card, to provide us with the necessary information to credit Points to your account. Additionally, we may hold earned Points in a pending status for up to 45 days for certain purchases, such as those that have high rates of return. Pended Points will be voided if you return such items. We will determine when to pend Points at our sole discretion. If we pend Points, you will be able to see them in your Thank U Cash account as pending, but you will not be able to use them until we release them to your Thank U Cash account.

            </p>
            <h4 class="h4">
                    How Can I Use Points?
            </h4>
            <p class="p">
                    For Savings on Purchases. Members can use Points for savings on purchases at certain merchants. You cannot use Points at all merchants. Visit www.thankucash.com to see a full list of where you can use Points. To use Points for savings, use your applicable Thank U Cash Identifier before paying. In some instances you may also need to enter your security PIN, which you can create at www.thankucash.com or during enrollment. To be eligible to use Points, you must have at least 10 Points in your Thank U Cash account. Points have a fixed value. However, you will generally receive savings of at least one naira for each 10 Points you use. For example, 200 Points will generally allow you receive at least N20 in savings. However, merchants may run promotions that may allow you to obtain a greater amount of savings per Point. merchants may also set a specific number of Points for which an item can be exchanged, such as 250 Points for a soft drink. Additionally, in some instances, you may receive a savings of less than one naira for each Point you use.
            </p>
            <h4 class="h4">
                    What Happens to My Points if I Return Merchandise?
            </h4>
            <p class="p">
                    If you return an item on which you earned a certain number of Points, we may deduct up to an equivalent amount of Points from your Thank U Cash account. For example, if you earned 20 Points for purchasing a vase and then return that vase, we may deduct 20 Points from your Thank U Cash account. Continuing this example, if you have fewer than 20 Points in your Thank U Cash account, we may deduct your remaining balance. If you used Points for savings on a purchase and then return the item purchased, the number of Points that you redeemed will generally be credited to your Thank U Cash account. However in some instances you may receive a store credit instead, depending on the policies of that merchant or merchant. Whether or not an item that you have purchased can be returned is subject to the policies of each applicable merchant or merchant and applicable law. Thank U Cash makes no representations and bears no responsibility for whether you can or cannot return any item you purchase. If you or we terminate your Thank U Cash account, or if the Thank U Cash program is terminated or otherwise modified, Points may be cancelled. You may not use cancelled Points. Points will be redeemed in the order in which they were earned.
                   <br/><br/> Limitations:
                    Points have a cash value. Points are your property. Points are issued without separate payment or other consideration by you, and exist at the sole discretion of Thank U Cash as part of a rewards program. Points can be purchased, redeemed for cash (With some terms and conditions attached) or any other monetary value or currency. Points may not be assigned, transferred or pledged to any third party, except as stated herein. Points may not be transferred by operation of law, such as by inheritance, in bankruptcy, or in connection with a divorce.
                    <br/><br/>  Separate Terms and Conditions and Benefits Provided by merchants or Merchants In addition to and independent of these Terms, merchants and other merchants may have their own terms and conditions, which describe specifically how Thank U Cash works at their locations. These terms and conditions may describe things such as how you earn Points at their locations, which items are excluded from earning Points and whether or not you need to link your Thank U Cash account with the merchant’s account in order to earn Points. In certain cases, the merchant or merchant may also provide you with additional benefits that are not directly related to Thank U Cash (e.g., price discounts on certain items). Thank U Cash bears no liability under or responsibility for any merchant-provided or merchant-provided terms and conditions, or for any associated additional benefits, which are offered solely by the applicable merchant or merchant, and may be changed or discontinued at that merchant or merchant’s exclusive discretion.

The account you select will survive, and all Points earned or pending on the other accounts will be consolidated into the single surviving Thank U Cash account. Please discard and/or cease using any Thank U Cash Identifiers relating to the other accounts, as any further activity on such accounts after they have been consolidated will not be credited to the surviving Thank U Cash account.

                            <p class="p">If you wish, you may pool your Thank U Cash account with the accounts of other Members. Up to three (3) accounts may be pooled. When pooled, each account will remain active and can be used to earn and use Points. However, all of the Points across the pooled accounts will form a single balance that can be used by each Member, and that will be subject to deductions relating to each Member. For example, if points are used for savings on purchases by one pooled Member, those points will be deducted from the total pooled balance on the account. Any pooled Member can use all of the pooled Points at any time, without the knowledge or consent of other pooled Members, regardless of whether that Member made any of the purchases that earned those Points. If you pool accounts, each Member will be able to view how other Members in the pooled accounts earn and use Points.For example, if a pooled Member redeems a promotional offer by purchasing a certain product at a merchant, then each Member in the pooled accounts could view that activity. Once pooled, Thank U Cash accounts cannot be unpooled. If you wish to cease pooling, you will need to open a new Thank U Cash account and cancel your existing account. If you cancel your existing account, you will no longer be able to use any Points that may remain in the pooled account for the other Members.

In the event that the customer service center is unable to resolve a complaint to your satisfaction, this section explains how claims can be resolved through mediation, arbitration, or litigation. It includes an arbitration provision. 
                                For this Dispute Resolution section: (a) “you” includes you, any person acting on your behalf including, if you are a minor, your parents and legal guardians; (b) “we” and “us” includes Thank U Cash, our merchants and any corporate parents, subsidiaries, affiliates or related persons or entities, and, if there is an assignment, the assignee and its corporate parents, subsidiaries, affiliates or related persons or entities; and (c) “claim” means any current or future claim, dispute or controversy relating to Thank U Cash, including these Terms, except for the validity, enforceability or scope of the arbitration provision. 
                                        Claim includes but is not limited to: (1) initial claims, counterclaims, crossclaims and third-party claims; (2) claims based upon contract, tort, fraud, statute, regulation, common law and equity; and (3) claims by or against any third party using or providing any product, service, or benefit in connection with any Thank U Cash account. You may not sell, assign or transfer a claim. Sending a Claim Notice. Before beginning a lawsuit, mediation or arbitration, you and we agree to send a written notice (a “Claim Notice”) to each party against whom a claim is asserted, in order to provide an opportunity to resolve the claim informally or through mediation. Go to or call www.thankucash.com or call +234 700 2000 000 for a sample Claim Notice to be sent to you. The Claim Notice must describe the claim and state the specific relief demanded. Notice to you may be sent to your email or mailing address. Notice to us must include your name, address and Thank U Cash account number and be sent to Connected Analytics Limited 7 Ibiyinka Olorunbe Close, Victoria Island, Lagos. If the claim proceeds to arbitration, the amount of any relief demanded in a Claim Notice will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator rules.

Further, neither you nor we will have the right to participate in a representative capacity or as a member of any class pertaining to any claim subject to arbitration. Arbitration procedures are generally simpler than the rules that apply in court, and discovery is more limited.

Other rights you or we would have in court may also not be available in arbitration.
